            <h3 class="i18n">What's a lockdrop?</h3>
            <div class="item-body">
              <p>
                A lockdrop is an event where coinholders on one
                network timelock their tokens for a fixed time period,
                demonstrating their interest in participating in the
                new network. In the Supernova lockdrop, multiple
                tokens (ATOM, BTC, and ETH) will be locked for 6
                months to obtain DUST.
              </p>
              <p>
                Participants may start their lock at any time during
                the 6-month period the Supernova lockdrop is open.
                Because all coins are locked for 6 months, earlier
                lockers will have their coins unlock first.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the lockdrop closes, the participating balances
                of each coin will be tallied up, and DUST will be
                distributed proportionately. For example, $1000 of BTC
                will correspond to the same amount of DUST as $1000 of
                ATOM.

            <h3 class="i18n">Why participate in the lockdrop?</h3>
            <div class="item-body">
              <p>
                Many reasons! For example, to become a part of the
                Supernova community, to earn fees as a validator, and
                to obtain future tokens from lockdrops that are done
                on the Supernova chain.

            <h3 class="i18n">Have the lockdrop contracts been audited?</h3>
            <div class="item-body">
              <p>
                The Supernova lockdrop contracts are available
                <a href="https://github.com/hicommonwealth/supernova-lockdrop"
                   target="_blank">here</a>.
                The ETH lockdrop contract was previously audited by
                Quantstamp, and was used in the Edgeware
                lockdrop.
              </p>
              <p>
                The BTC and ETH locking procedures
                will also undergo further auditing and/or formal
                verification.

          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <h3 class="i18n">Are there any other considerations for locking?</h3>
            <div class="item-body">
              <p>
                Since the Cosmos Hub does not support locking of
                tokens, any ATOM holder with ATOMs bonded will be
                considered locked on Supernova. ETH holders who locked
                on Edgeware will also be recognized as
                participants, although ETH holders who signaled on
                Edgeware will not be recognized.

                Supernova is a Cosmos Zone, built using the Cosmos
                SDK, that is dedicated to performing lockdrops for
                BTC, ETH and ATOM holders, and eventually other
                tokenholders who are awarded DUST as well. As IBC is
                built, Supernova will also be bridged to other zones
                and chains.

                Supernova acts like a bridge between the existing

                projects by creating a critical mass of community

            <div class="item-body">
              <p>
                Any project can choose to allocate a portion of their
                tokens to a Supernova airdrop or lockdrop, optionally
                with a vesting schedule. Then, DUST holders can lock 
                their tokens to receive an allocation in the new chain.
                We'll provide software for verifying the final
                distribution.

              <p>
                For new projects (Supernova clients) to seed their

                functionalities to do dynamic decentralized airdrops. 
                For other Cosmos SDK chains, this process for 
                coordinating with the Supernova chain, itself a Cosmos 
                SDK chain, is frictionless. To allow for this 
                flexibility, Supernova is built on top of the
                Cosmos SDK. By building on top of the SDK, Supernova
                gets two things&mdash;the ability to connect to other
                chains via the Cosmos Hub, as well as the ability to
                build on top of an growing ecosystem of modules.

              <p>
                DUST is the native token of the Supernova

                There is a static supply of DUST of 21 million in

                circulation. The amount of DUST mined each block will
                undergo a halving every 4 years, so DUST will be a
                deflationary asset, whose supply curve mimics that of

              <p>
                Validators interested in participating in maintaining
                the security of the Supernova network should run
                Supernova’s initial testnet software. After validating
                on the testnet, they will be eligible to participate in
                the initial genesis set of validators.
              </p>
              <p>
                At network genesis, we expect 200 slots for validators
                to be available. Slots will go to validators with
                the most DUST bonded or delegated.

                Nothing. The Cosmos thesis is that you don’t need to
                use a one-size-fits-all security model, but rather,
                you can pay a much smaller premium in order to
                transact on a chain that has less at stake than
                securing critical financial assets.

            <h3 class="i18n">If Supernova is not intended to secure critical assets, then how will DUST accrue value?</h3>
            <div class="item-body">
              <p>
                Supernova is constructed to simply act as an oracle
                for the value of tokens custodied on their native
                chains. The utility of the chain increases as more new
                applications are onboarded onto the zone and start
                using it to launch new communities, and DUST holders
                begin to self-organize as their own community.
