### Internationalization

Please feel free to contribute translations. To add a translation, please
include:

- A new YAML file in the `/i18n/` directory translating the homepage,
  e.g. `fr.yaml`.
- New FAQ enties in `faq.yaml` in the translated language.
- Also update `/i18n/languages.yaml` with the language you've added.
