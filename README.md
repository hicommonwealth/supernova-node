## Supernova: A chain to launch new chains
Supernova is a Cosmos Zone to launch other zones, using lockdrops as a community building mechanism.
Participants who wish to distribute their token to engaged community members can use Supernova to launch distributed lockdrops

Supernova is launched by [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) and [Commonwealth Labs](https://commonwealth.im/)
and built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).
